            <p class = "paragraph">During the quarantine, the freshman cabinet wanted to find ways to include and engage the student body. To set out to solve this problem, we decided to take action by organizing different activities led by student teachers on zoom calls throughout the week. By getting some coders on the job, we were able to create a website to make the sign up process easier (by Jason Zhang, Saarang Bondalapati, Jacob Ismael, and Atli Arnarsson).</p>
            <h1 class = "center">Who can join the meetings?</h1>
            <p class ="paragraph">Anybody (in highschool)! Just sign up on the signup page through a google form, and follow the <a href="https://www.instagram.com/mvhs.2023/?hl=en" target="_blank">mvhs.2023 instagram</a> to get updates on the newest activities that you can join!</p>
